# Large-Scale Text Analysis Using Generative Language Models

This project demonstrates how to perform large-scale text analysis using a generative language model (e.g., GPT-4) via the OpenAI API. The framework follows a semi-automated pipeline inspired by recent research in computational social science. It is designed to classify and interpret textual data across complex and abstract dimensions.

## Key Features

- Use of large language models (LLMs) to categorize textual data.
- Application of custom prompt frameworks to extract structured insights from unstructured text.
- Chain-of-thought prompting to improve model interpretability and reasoning.
- Integration with OpenAI's API for automated analysis at scale.
- Extensible for sentiment analysis, behavioral pattern detection, or topic classification.

## Repository Contents

- `Test MUM AI.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook illustrating how to set up prompts, send them to the OpenAI API, and process the responses.
- Instructional cells on constructing prompts and interpreting rationales.
- Example text data and formatted responses from the model.
